Welcome to the Sudoku Solver

This Sudoku solver is a Python program using a Backtracking Algorithm that allows you to solve Sudoku puzzles quickly and easily. Players can create puzzles by manually entering numbers as needed. Three levels of random puzzles can also be generated (Easy, Medium, Difficult). 
Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition.
